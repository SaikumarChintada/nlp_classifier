 but it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity
 should never have been brought out of hibernation
102minute infomercial
annoying  heavyhanded
carries a little too much ai nt  shecute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff 
derrida is all but useless
featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dimwitted 
here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation 
i do nt know why steven seagal is considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money 
indescribably bad
it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic 
it s one of the worst of the entire franchise 
it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character 
longley s film lacks balance  and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context 
much about the film  including some of its casting  is frustratingly unconvincing 
poorly written  murky and weakly acted  the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo 
should nt have been made
stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film 
the film is deadly dull
the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor  ethnic slurs 
they wo nt enjoy the movie at all 
this toolong  spoofy update of shakespeare s macbeth does nt sustain a high enough level of invention 
you ll swear that you ve seen it all before  even if you ve never come within a mile of the longest yard 
 a pretentious mess 
 about as exciting to watch as two lastplace basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season 
 feels as if lrb there s rrb a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good  hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something 
 lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
 puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and selfconscious material to make it sting 
 you can be forgiven for realizing that you ve spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already 
 the country bears  should never have been brought out of hibernation 
 bad  is the operative word for  bad company 
 solaris  is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work 
93 minutes of unrecoverable life
a bad mannered  ugly and destructive little 
a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over
a beyondlame satire
a bland  surfacey way that does nt offer any insight into why  for instance  good things happen to bad people
a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe
a cheap  ludicrous attempt
a cinematic disaster
a complete waste
a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics 
a deeply unpleasant experience
a derivative collection of horror and scifi cliches 
a disturbing disregard
a failure of storytelling
a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along
a frustrating patchwork 
a giant step backward for a director i admire
a great movie it is not
a huge disappointment coming
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her 
a long  dull procession of despair  set to cello music
a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character  especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix s
a lower iq than when i had entered
a meanspirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
a more confused  less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002
a movie that  quite simply  should nt have been made 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie  a vampire soap opera that does nt make much
a pandora s box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest
a phlegmatic bore 
a plodding teen remake that s so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists 
a preposterous  prurient whodunit 
a really bad imitation
a ripoff twice removed  modeled after lrb seagal s rrb earlier copycat under siege
a sad  soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads
a selfindulgent script
a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle s walker and toss it at the screen in frustration
a soso  madefortv something posing as a real movie 
a squirminducing fishoutofwater formula
a superfluous sequel
a tearjerker that does nt and a thriller that wo nt
a terrible movie
a thriller without a lot of thrills 
a tired  unnecessary retread  a stale copy of a picture that was nt all that great to begin with 
a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities 
a whole lot of nada
a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back
about as exciting to watch as two lastplace basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season
absurdly inappropriate  comedy  scenes
acting that could be any flatter
after seeing the film  i can tell you that there s no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it 
aggravating and tedious 
all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s 
all looks and plays like a  40 million version of a game you re more likely to enjoy on a computer 
all the story gives us is flashing red lights  a rattling noise  and a bump on the head
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion  which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships 
an 88minute highlight reel that s 86 minutes too long
an airless  prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hardsell imagemongering you ll wonder if lopez s publicist should share screenwriting credit 
an annoying orgy
an appalling  ace ventura  ripoff that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak  former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism
an excruciating film
an incredibly irritating comedy
an inexplicable  utterly distracting blunder at the very end
an insultingly unbelievable final act
an ugly  pointless  stupid movie 
an uncomfortable movie
an unendurable viewing experience
analyze that  is one of those crass  contrived sequels that not only fails on its own  but makes you secondguess your affection for the original 
and it s not that funny  which is just generally insulting 
another selfconsciously overwritten story about a ragtag bunch of wouldbe characters that team up for a ca nt  miss heist  only to have it all go wrong 
another weepy southern boreathon 
apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres
are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie
are less than adorable
are not at all entertaining
are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes 
around a core of flimsy  or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas
as a relic from a bygone era  and its convolutions  feel silly rather than plausible
as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film s shooting schedule waiting to scream   got aids yet
as my friend david cross would call it   hungryman portions of bad 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrottersgenerals game  juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you d expect from the guyinadress genre 
as steamy as last week s pork dumplings 
as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention
assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce  because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low
at one man s occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention  a terrifying study of bourgeois
attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie
avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation  and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates 
bad and baffling from the getgo 
bad mannered  ugly and destructive little 
baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic
be galled that you ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie
be me  fighting off the urge to doze
be shaking your head all the way to the credits
bean drops the ball too many times 
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low  very low  very very low  for the masquerade to work
become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past
been discovered  indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again
been told and retold
begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain
being surprisingly dull
better off staying on the festival circuit
big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that  zany  does nt necessarily mean  funny  
blandly go where we went 8 movies ago
bogged down in earnest dramaturgy
bore most audiences
boredom to the point of collapse  turning into a black hole of dullness  from which no interesting concept can escape
both overstuffed and undernourished 
bottomofthebill
brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch
burn the negative and the script
but it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity
but the movie that does nt really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
by a central plot that s peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about
by halfbaked setups and sluggish pacing
by the movie s sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick
ca nt disguise the fact that it s inauthentic at its core and that its story just is nt worth telling 
ca nt remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops
call me a coldhearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie  but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid 
can be forgiven for realizing that you ve spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already
capped with pointless extremes
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly 
cheap manipulation or corny conventions
cheesy backdrops  ridiculous action sequences  and many tired jokes about men in heels
cinematic disaster
cliches  painful improbability and murky
clumsily staged violence overshadows everything  including most of the actors 
collapses into an inhalant blackout
come to term an  ambitious failure
comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 
comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break
completely contradicts everything kieslowski s work aspired to  including the condition of art
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions  especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
contains no wit  only labored gags 
contrived  nonsensical and formulaic
controlaltdelete simone as quickly as possible
could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls 
could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again 
could pass for a thirteenyearold s book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451
crass  contrived sequels
crude humor and vulgar innuendo
d rather listen to old tori amos records
deeply unpleasant
delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story 
depraved  incoherent  instantly disposable
derive from this choppy and sloppy affair
designed as a reverie about memory and regret  but the only thing you ll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it 
devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot
difficult  endless
directed the film from the back of a taxicab
disappointment coming
disintegrates into a dreary  humorless soap opera
disposable  kitchensink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood
do little to salvage this filmmaker s flailing reputation
do nt need to know your icet s from your coolj s to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned  something is rotten in the state of california
does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along
does nt care about cleverness  wit or any other kind of intelligent humor 
does nt have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
does nt really believe in it  and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate  comedy  scenes 
downright transparent is the script s endless assault of embarrassingly hamfisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a  cooler  pg13 rating 
drags during its 112minute length
due to stodgy  soap operaish dialogue  the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 
dull  unimaginative
each scene drags  underscoring the obvious  and
electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness
ends so horrendously confusing
entirely witless and
especially thin stretched over the nearly 80minute running time
even close to being the barnburningly bad movie it promised it would be
even though i could not stand them
everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial
exercise in narcissism and selfcongratulation disguised as a tribute 
exploitative garbage
faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance  in a movie that is definitely meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance 
fails as a dystopian movie  as a retooling of fahrenheit 451  and even as a ripoff of the matrix 
fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for lrb or worth rooting against  for that matter rrb
fails to rise above its disgusting source material
falls victim to sloppy plotting  an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting
farfetched premise  convoluted plot 
feel more like a nonstop cry for attention  than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment
feels like a prison stretch
feels secondhand  familiar  and not in a good way
festers in just such a dungpile that you d swear you
filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is nt incomprehensible
find it uninteresting
flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community
folds under its own thinness
for independence  complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence  but not a drop of human blood
for the most part  the film is deadly dull
forgets to make it entertaining
from a college comedy that s target audience has nt graduated from junior high school
from this choppy and sloppy affair
full of cheesy dialogue
generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull
get paid enough to sit through crap like this
given it a onestar rating
god help us  but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves
godard s ode to tackling life s wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess  in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that s unfocused and tediously exasperating 
going nowhere fast
greatest mistake
guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy
had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle s walker and toss it at the screen in frustration
hampered by taylor s cartoonish performance and the film s illconsidered notion
hard to say who might enjoy this
has about 34th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity
has become apparent that the franchise s best years are long past
has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie  which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline 
has none of the crackle of  fatal attraction    9 12 weeks   or even  indecent proposal   and feels more like lyne s stolid remake of  lolita 
has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it
has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos
hate it because it s lousy
have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept
have to check your brain at the door
having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material
he needs to pull his head out of his butt
headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an allnight tequila bender
here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time
highminded snoozer 
his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now
hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is
horribly depressing
how can you charge money for this  
how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time
huge disappointment coming
humorless soap opera
i ca nt begin to tell you how tedious  how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents 
i could not stand them
i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art 
i liked the original short story but this movie  even at an hour and twentysome minutes  it s too long and it goes nowhere
i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops
i would go back and choose to skip it 
idiotically uses the website feardotcomcom or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea
if the film has a problem  its shortness disappoints 
if you re the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix
imagine lrb if possible rrb a pasolini film without passion or politics  or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor  and you have some idea of the glum  numb experience of watching o fantasma 
in a contest to see who can outbadact the other
in addition to the overcooked  hamfisted direction  which has all the actors reaching for the back row  the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry 
in fact  it does nt even seem like she tried 
in other words  it s badder than bad 
in this pretentious mess
incompetent  incoherent or just plain crap
infantile  redundant  sloppy
instantly forgettable
insufferably naive
interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience
into a deadly bore
irredeemably awful
is   scooby  do nt 
is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe 
is a disaster of a story  full of holes and completely lacking in chills 
is a horrible movie
is a movie filled with unlikable  spiteful idiots
is a plodding mess
is a truly  truly bad movie
is almost entirely witless and inane  carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh 
is as deep as a petri dish and as wellcharacterized
is capped with pointless extremes
is cruel  misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy 
is downright doltish and uneventful
is exactly what it wants to be  an atrociously  mindnumbingly  indescribably bad movie
is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a hightech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman 
is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow
is inane and awful
is just garbage 
is like being trapped at a bad rock concert
is meaningless  vapid and devoid
is mildmannered  beenthere material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant  the outrageous
is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest
is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of notsofunny gags  scattered moments of lazy humor
is nt that stealing harvard is a horrible movie  if only it were that grand a failure 
is often preachy and
is one of my least favourite emotions  especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
is oppressively heavy 
is probably the funniest person in the film  which gives you an idea just how bad it was 
is rote spookiness  with nary an original idea lrb or role  or edit  or score  or anything  really rrb in sight
is shallow  offensive and redundant
is significantly less charming than listening to a fouryearold with a taste for exaggeration
is so bad it does nt improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen
is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining 
is so prolonged and boring it is nt even close to being the barnburningly bad movie it promised it would be
is stiff or just plain bad
is that  even in all its director s cut glory  he s made a film that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything
is that it stinks 
is the kathie lee gifford of film directors  sadly proving once again ego does nt always go hand in hand with talent
is the script s endless assault of embarrassingly hamfisted sex jokes
is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories
is virtually unwatchable 
is worse  the poor acting by the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen
it completely contradicts everything kieslowski s work aspired to  including the condition of art
it does nt make for great cinema
it is dark  brooding and slow  and takes its central idea way too seriously 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middleage
it ll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around
it makes me say the obvious  abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachykeen and so tubthumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it
it s a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over  but
it s a loathsome movie 
it s a terrible movie in every regard  and utterly painful to watch 
it s also too stupid to realize that they ve already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
it s been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie  but
it s difficult to imagine that a more confused  less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 
it s harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
it s kind of insulting  both to men and women 
it s obvious lrb jegyu is rrb trying for poetry  what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom
it s possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel  but the result is more puzzling than unsettling 
it s so lackluster
it s still tainted by cliches  painful improbability and murky points 
it s unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald s  let alone some savvy street activism
it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at 
it would be easy for critics to shred it
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity
its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors  morgan freeman and ashley judd
its sleazy moralizing
itself is just sooooo tired 
julia roberts hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence  lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm 
just is nt worth telling
k19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories 
killing time  that s all that s going on here 
know why steven seagal is considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good
lackluster at best
lame and sophomoric
laziness and arrogance
leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes  maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies
left an acrid test in this gourmet s mouth
less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is 
like a madeforhomevideo quickie
like being trapped at a bad rock concert
like many western action films  this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing 
limps along on a squirminducing fishoutofwater formula that goes nowhere and goes there very  very slowly
little action  almost no suspense or believable tension  onedimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that
ll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser
ll only put you to sleep 
long and relentlessly saccharine film
look smeary and blurry  to the point of distraction
loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless specialeffects excess 
losing its focus  point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages  overblown drama and bruce willis
low  very low  very very low
lrb a rrb rather thinlyconceived movie 
lrb but rrb there is nt much about k19 that s unique or memorable 
lrb n rrb o matter how much good will the actors generate  showtime eventually folds under its own thinness 
m convinced i could keep a family of five blind  crippled  amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking
m sure the filmmaker would disagree  but  honestly  i do nt see the point
made me want to pack raw dough in my ears
mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film  which is often preachy and poorly acted 
makes me say the obvious  abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here 
manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves
marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending
may be galled that you ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie
me say the obvious  abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here
meaningless  vapid and devoid
men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance 
messy  murky  unsatisfying
mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful
mindnumbingly  indescribably bad
miss it altogether
more in common with a fireworks display than a movie  which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline
more tiring than anything
most devastating flaw
most of the problems with the film do nt derive from the screenplay  but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
mr goyer s loose  unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way 
murder by numbers  is nt a great movie
my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it 
nearly as dreadful
needlessly poor quality
never comes close to being either funny or scary
never rises above superficiality 
no charm  no laughs
no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer
no one involved  save dash  shows the slightest aptitude for acting  and the script  credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest  tron  anderson  seems entirely improvised 
none of this is very original
not counting a few grossout comedies i ve been trying to forget  this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved
obnoxious 88minute
of  let s get this thing over with
of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels
of empty  fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun
of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics
of the biggest disappointments of the year
of the same old garbage
of this wornout  pandering palaver
of what critics have come to term an  ambitious failure
offensive and redundant
on its icy face  the new film is a subzero version of monsters  inc  without the latter s imagination  visual charm or texture 
one baaaaaaaaad movie
one of the most depressing moviegoing experiences i can think of
one of the worst films of the summer
only so much baked cardboard
oppressively heavy
other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low
out there surrender  9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life
overwrought  melodramatic bodiceripper
pack your knitting needles 
painfully formulaic and stilted
pair that with really poor comedic writing  and you ve got a huge mess 
particularly joyless  and exceedingly dull 
pathetically compare notes about their budding amours
peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about
phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism
pity anyone who sees this mishmash 
plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up
plotless collection of moronic stunts
pointless  meandering
pompous and garbled 
poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines
possibly the worst film
predictably soulless technotripe 
press the delete key 
pretentious mess 
proves tiresome  with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paperthin characterizations and facile situations
pushes its agenda too forcefully
putrid writing  direction and timing with a smile that says   if i stay positive  maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures  drunken master
rambling and incoherent manifesto
rather  pity anyone who sees this mishmash 
re never quite sure where selfpromotion ends and the truth begins
realizing that you ve spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already
really long  slow and dreary time
refusal to recognise any of the signposts  as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map
relentlessly nasty
remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops
require the patience of job to get through this interminable  shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture
riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it
rotten in almost every single facet of production
run for your lives 
runs out of steam after a half hour 
s a big  comforting jar of marmite  to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness
s a pedestrian  flat drama that screams out  amateur  in almost every frame 
s a terrible movie in every regard  and utterly painful to watch 
s an 88minute highlight reel that s 86 minutes too long
s as sorry a mess as its director s diabolical debut  mad cows 
s crap on a leash  far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante s similarly styled gremlins 
s dull  spiritless  silly and monotonous  an ultraloud blast of pointless mayhem  going nowhere fast
s harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
s just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar 
s lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another
s not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy
s not very well shot or composed or edited
s one of the worst of the entire franchise 
s probably not easy to make such a worthless film
s simply stupid  irrelevant and deeply 
s so notatallgood
s taken one of the world s most fascinating stories and made it dull  lifeless  and irritating
s unfocused and tediously exasperating
saw how bad this movie was
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres
seagal ran out of movies years ago  and this is just the proof 
see this piece of crap
seem motivated by nothing short of dull  braindeadening hangover
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product s unshapely look
seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material 
selfmutilating sideshow geeks
shallow  noisy and pretentious
shapeless inconsequential move
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy selfindulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors
should be punishable by chainsaw
showtime eventually folds under its own thinness 
silly  and gross 
sit through a crummy  wannabehip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies  when you could just rent those movies instead  let alone seek out a respectable new one
sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you re sure to get more out of the latter experience
slapdash disaster
slow  predictable and not very amusing
smug  artificial  illconstructed and fatally overlong  it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite  degenerating into a pious  preachy soap opera
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it 
so horrendously confusing
so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it
so prolonged and boring
solaris  is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work 
soulless technotripe
