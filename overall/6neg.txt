almost entirely witless inane  carrying every gag three times beyond limit sustain laugh 
deep petri dish characterized
capped pointless extremes
cruel  misanthropic stuff weak claims surrealism black comedy

like being trapped bad rock concert
meaningless  vapid devoid
mild mannered  been material given pedestrian spin director needed touch flamboyant  outrageous
