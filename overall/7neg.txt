nt stealing harvard horrible movie    were grand failure 
often preachy
least favourite emotions  especially put  minutes 
oppressively heavy 
probably funniest person film  gives idea bad 
rote spookiness  nary original idea    role  edit  score  anything  really    sight
shallow  offensive redundant
significantly less charming listening four old taste exaggeration
bad does nt improve upon experience staring blank screen
intent hammering home message forgets make entertaining 
prolonged boring nt close being barn burningly bad movie promised
stiff plain bad
 director cut glory  made film barely shocking  barely interesting  barely anything
stinks 
kathie lee gifford film directors  sadly proving once again ego does nt always hand hand talent
script endless assault embarrassingly ham fisted sex jokes
too pedestrian filmmaker bring edge personality rising place set apart deep south stories
virtually unwatchable 
worse  poor acting ensemble cast  flat dialogue vincent r nebrida gutless direction laurice guillen
completely contradicts everything kieslowski aspired  including condition art
does nt make great cinema
dark  brooding slow  takes central idea too seriously 
supremely unfunny unentertaining watch middle age
ll dollar theatres time christmas rolls around
makes obvious  abandon hope good movie ye enter here 
reduces complexities bromides slogans gets preachy keen tub thumpingly loud makes feel like chump sitting through
bad sign re rooting film hurry subjects  deaths documentary 
loathsome movie 
terrible movie every regard  utterly painful watch 
too stupid realize ve already seen exact same movie hundred times
been  months  preview screenings since last walked movie 
difficult imagine more confused  less interesting more sloppily made film possibly down road  
harder still believe anyone right mind 
kind insulting  both men women 
obvious    je gyu    trying poetry  gets instead has lyricism limerick scrawled public restroom
possible something hip transgressive being attempted here stubbornly refused gel  result more puzzling unsettling 
lackluster
still tainted cliches  painful improbability murky points 
unlikely inspire anything more visit mcdonald  let alone savvy street activism
traps audiences series relentlessly nasty situations pay considerable ransom not looking 
easy critics shred
audacious ambitions sabotaged pomposity
lack logic misuse fine actors  morgan freeman ashley judd
sleazy moralizing
itself sooooo tired 
julia roberts hands awards    phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism
another combination bad animation mindless violence  lacking slightest bit wit charm 
nt worth telling
k  not down annals cinema great submarine stories 
killing time  going here
