no involved  save dash  shows slightest aptitude acting  script  credited director abdul malik abbott ernest   tron   anderson  seems entirely improvised  
none very original
not counting few gross comedies  ve been trying forget  film long time made bolt theater  minutes  
not mention inappropriate wildly undeserved
obnoxious  minute
  let  thing
being overrun corrupt hedonistic weasels
empty  fetishistic violence murder casual fun
movie leaves vague impressions nasty aftertaste little clear memory operational mechanics
biggest disappointments
same old garbage
worn  pandering palaver
critics term    ambitious failure
offensive redundant
icy face  new film subzero version monsters  inc   without latter  imagination  visual charm texture  
baaaaaaaaad movie
depressing movie going experiences
worst films summer
much baked cardboard
oppressively heavy
money why distinguished actor stoop low
surrender    minutes unrecoverable life
overwrought  melodramatic bodice ripper
pack knitting needles  
painfully formulaic stilted
pair really poor comedic writing      ve got huge mess  
particularly joyless  exceedingly dull 
pathetically compare notes budding amours
peppered false starts populated characters nearly impossible care
phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism
pity anyone sees mishmash  
plays like student film guys desperately quentin tarantino grow
plotless collection moronic stunts
pointless  meandering
pompous garbled  
poorly paced fit pootie tang between punchlines
possibly worst film
predictably soulless techno tripe  
press delete key  
pretentious mess  
proves tiresome  surface histrionics failing compensate paper thin characterizations facile situations
pushes agenda too forcefully
putrid writing  direction timing smile says    stay positive  maybe channel greatest pictures  drunken master
rambling incoherent manifesto
rather  pity anyone sees mishmash  
 re never quite sure where self promotion ends truth begins
realizing  ve spent past  minutes looking watch waiting frida die already
really long  slow dreary time
refusal recognise signposts  discovering through bitter end without map
relentlessly nasty
