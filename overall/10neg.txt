remember last time saw worse stunt editing cheaper action movie production values extreme ops
require patience job through interminable  shapeless documentary swinging subculture
riddled unanswered questions requires gargantuan leaps faith watch
rotten almost every single facet production
run lives  
runs steam half hour  
 big  comforting jar marmite  slathered crackers served feast bleakness
 pedestrian  flat drama screams   amateur   almost every frame  
 terrible movie every regard  utterly painful watch  
  minute highlight reel   minutes too long
 sorry mess director  diabolical debut  mad cows  
 crap leash    far too polite scale lunatic heights joe dante  similarly styled gremlins  
 dull  spiritless  silly monotonous   ultra loud blast pointless mayhem  going nowhere fast
 harder still believe anyone right mind  
 easily wait pay per view dollar  
 lazy movie avoid solving problem trying distract us solution another
 not comedic moment romantic comedy
 not very shot composed edited
 worst entire franchise  
 probably not easy make such worthless film
 simply stupid  irrelevant deeply 
 not good
 taken world  fascinating stories made dull  lifeless  irritating
 unfocused tediously exasperating
saw bad movie
scarcely worth mention apart reporting number tumbleweeds blowing through empty theatres
seagal ran movies years ago  proof  
piece crap
seem motivated nothing short dull  brain deadening hangover
seemingly disgusted lazy material finished product  unshapely
seems ransacked every old world war ii movie overly familiar material  
self mutilating sideshow geeks
shallow  noisy pretentious
shapeless inconsequential move
shot like postcard overacted boozy self indulgence brings worst otherwise talented actors
should punishable chainsaw
showtime eventually folds under own thinness  
silly    gross   
sit through crummy  wannabe hip crime comedy refers incessantly old movies  rent those movies instead  let alone seek respectable new
sitting through something akin act cinematic penance
skip turd pick nose instead  re sure more latter experience
slapdash disaster
slow  predictable not very amusing
smug  artificial  ill constructed fatally overlong     never finds consistent tone lacks bite  degenerating pious  preachy soap opera
boring target audience talked through  
horrendously confusing
many flaws easy critics shred
prolonged boring
solaris    shapeless inconsequential move relying viewer  
soulless techno tripe
