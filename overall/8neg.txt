know why steven seagal considered star  nor why keeps being cast action films none ever good
lackluster best
lame sophomoric
laziness arrogance
leading tragedy somehow guessable few minutes  maybe echoes intolerable morbidity many recent movies
left acrid test gourmet mouth
less funny should less funny thinks 
like made home video quickie
like being trapped bad rock concert
like many western action films  thriller too loud thoroughly overbearing 
limps along squirm inducing fish water formula goes nowhere goes very  very slowly
little action  almost no suspense believable tension  dimensional characters wazoo sets
ll thinking  ways leave loser
ll put sleep 
long relentlessly saccharine film
smeary blurry  point distraction
loses faith own viability succumbs joyless special effects excess 
losing focus  point purpose mess mixed messages  blown drama bruce willis
low  very low  very very low
      rather thinly conceived movie 
      nt much k  unique memorable 
   n    o matter much good actors generate  showtime eventually folds under own thinness 
m convinced keep family five blind  crippled  amish people alive situation better british soldiers keeping themselves kicking
m sure filmmaker disagree   honestly  nt point
made pack raw dough ears
mainstream audiences find little interest film  often preachy poorly acted 
makes obvious  abandon hope good movie ye enter here 
manipulating collective fear without bestowing subject intelligence sincerity unequivocally deserves
marred beyond redemption disastrous ending
may galled ve wasted nearly hours own precious life silly little puddle movie
obvious  abandon hope good movie ye enter here
meaningless  vapid devoid
men black ii achieves ultimate insignificance   
messy  murky  unsatisfying
mildly unimpressive despairingly awful
mind numbingly  indescribably bad
miss altogether
more common fireworks display movie  normally expected characters storyline
more tiring anything
devastating flaw
problems film nt derive screenplay  rather mediocre performances actors involved
mr goyer loose  unaccountable direction technically sophisticated worst 
murder numbers  nt great movie
sweet has many flaws easy critics shred 
nearly dreadful
needlessly poor quality
never comes close being either funny scary
never rises above superficiality 
no charm  no laughs
no disguising worst films summer
